# DC-Voter-Registration-T-Test
**Purpose:** The purpose of this project was to explore how voter registration has changed since the 2016 election. We predicted there could be significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
**Question:** How much has voter registration changed since the 2016 election? Has the pandemic actually effected how many people are registering to vote?

**Data:** Washington, DC 2016 & 2020 Voter Registration

**Results:** Data revealed that an average of 4,074 voters registered per observed day in 2016, versus an average of 2,422 voters registered per observed day in 2020. That is a huge difference! Also, with a T value of 2.44 and p value of <.05, it is appropriate to deem a significant change.
